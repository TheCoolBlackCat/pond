# InfoLab21 Ducks

In order to introduce [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging "Wikipedia") to our undergraduate students in the [School of Computing and Communications](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/) at Lancaster University, we have printed duck stickers based on these files. This is somewhat more environmentally friendly than bulk buying small plastic ducks and students can attach the stickers to their laptops.

## Acknowledgements

The original duck was drawn in August 2018 by Katie Rayson and converted to machine readable format by James Rayson. John Vidler and Chris Bull converted this original to the various format files here with white borders and no background for the stickers. Thanks to Angie Chandler for the repository name suggestion.
