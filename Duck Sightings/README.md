# Duck Sightings

To add a duck sighting, either find the folder for the location, or create a new folder for where you found the duck.

Try to keep the locations fairly generic, in the case of our original duck at Lancaster University, put all campus-sightings in 'Duck Sightings/Lancaster University/'

Please use descriptive names for the photos, too - Thanks!
